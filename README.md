MAGPIE is a tool for analyzing thousands of protein-ligand interactions at once. MAGPIE generates an interactive 3D visualization from a set of protein complex structures that share a target ligand, as well as sequence logo-style frequency graphs that show all the amino acids from the set of protein binders that interact with user-selected target ligand positions. MAGPIE is compatible with small molecule or protein ligands.
